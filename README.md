# training-recording

Each class is broken out according to topics. Note these are recordings of live events, often unscripted and are meant to be a record for attendees to refer back. If available then a PDF version of the slides used is also stored here.  If you would like to attend a live session, and get live Q&A, and newer features then register at https://software.seek.intel.com/open-vino-training for future events.
